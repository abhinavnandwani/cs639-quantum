    "## Q4: Quantum Teleportation Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum teleportation is a fascinating process that allows the transfer of a quantum state from one location to another without physically moving the particle carrying the state. It relies on two key resources: entanglement and classical communication. In this protocol, Alice holds a quantum state, $|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle$, which she wants to send to Bob. By sharing a pair of entangled qubits and performing a sequence of operations involving measurement and classical communication, Alice and Bob achieve the transfer of $|\\psi\\rangle$ to Bob's qubit.\n"
